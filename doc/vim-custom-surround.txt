INTRODUCTION                                 *vim-custom-surround-introduction*

|vim-custom-surround| is a simple plugin that lets you surround the word under
cursor or the current selection with custom strings. The main goal is to use
with non trivial but recurrent surrounding patterns. The main diference to
others surrounding plugins like delimitMate or ultisnips is that they apply
the patterns before typing the text to be surrounded, which should be the most
cases when writing code. But, for the times you forget to surround or decide
to do it later, this plugin comes in handy.

Commands~
                                                 *vim-custom-surround-commands*

                                             *SurroundWord*
:SurroundWord {before} [{after}]
        Apply the surround pattern to the word under cursor. It uses the
        movement commands 'b' and 'e' to delimit the word. The pattern is
        defined in {before} and {after}, and must be the desired characters
        directly typed, no need for strings. If {after} is omitted, the value
        from {before} is also used for the closing pattern.

                                             *SurroundSelection*
:SurroundSelection {before} [{after}]
        Apply the surround pattern to the selected text. It uses the position
        values of the macros "'<" and "'>" to delimit the surround positions,
        so calling it outside visual mode will apply it to the last selected
        area. Can be used with any of the visual modes.

        See |SurroundWord| for details of the arguments.

Functions~
                                                *vim-custom-surround-functions*

                                             *customsurround#map()*
customsurround#map({mapping}, {strbefore}, [{strafter}])
        Create a |nnoremap| for |SurroundWord| and a |vnoremap| for
        |SurroundSelection| using the keys from {mapping} and passing
        {strbefore} and {strafter} as parameters for both commands.

        {mapping} String
          The keys to be used for the mappings.

        {strbefore} {strafer} String
          The strings to be used as before and after surrounding patterns.
          The parameter {strafter} is optional, if missing, the parameter
          {strbefore} is used in its place. It's recommended using single
          quotes to facilitate the usage of special characters, like:

            call customsurround#map('<Leader>m', '\(', '\)')

          The above mapping using double quotes should be:

            call customsurround#map("<Leader>m", "\\(", "\\)")
